8.5.18
This empty class is so the XML View Layout files can use the XML tag <HomeScreen> and reference the swift functions in this VC.
 
TODO: 8.18.18 - DONE (8.23.18) Change to Moleskine-like Timeline view
TODO: 8.23.18 - prefersStatusBarHidden for iPhone X does not work. This code was added to deal with X but its not working.

8.25.18 - Note: There is currently no safe way to explicitly bind a delegate to the layoutNode's owner class. Attempting to pass self as a constant or state variable will result in a retain cycle (which is why owner-binding is done implicitly rather than manually).
 
 This is why I'm getting a 'does not have an outlet named xxxxx' because the layout file cannot find TimelineScreen class.
 
 if you package custom components into a separate module then you will need to refer to them using their fully-qualified name in your XML.
