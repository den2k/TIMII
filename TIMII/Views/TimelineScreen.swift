8.25.18
Note: There is currently no safe way to explicitly bind a delegate to the layoutNode's owner class. Attempting
to pass self as a constant or state variable will result in a retain cycle (which is why owner-binding is done
implicitly rather than manually). This is why I'm getting a 'does not have an outlet named xxxxx' because the
layout file cannot find TimelineScreen class. If you package custom components into a separate module then you will need
to refer to them using their fully-qualified name in your XML.
