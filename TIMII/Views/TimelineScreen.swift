 TODO: 8.18.18 - DONE (8.23.18) Change to Moleskine-like Timeline view
 TODO: 8.25.18 - DONE (8.27.18) Expand day view when tapped.
 TODO: 8.23.18 - DEL (9.16.18) prefersStatusBarHidden for iPhone Xx does not work. This code was added to deal with X but its not working.  Fixed using layout and adding padding from subview.
 TODO: 8.28.18 - DONE (9.16.18) Show dates in view.
 TODO: 8.28.18 - Add Journal editing capability into this view on tap
 
8.25.18
Note: There is currently no safe way to explicitly bind a delegate to the layoutNode's owner class. Attempting
to pass self as a constant or state variable will result in a retain cycle (which is why owner-binding is done
implicitly rather than manually). This is why I'm getting a 'does not have an outlet named xxxxx' because the
layout file cannot find TimelineScreen class. If you package custom components into a separate module then you will need
to refer to them using their fully-qualified name in your XML.

 9.13.18 - I stopped working on this screen view controller because I could not figure out
 how to increment a row between VC and the layout views. So I moved on to using a regular
 tableViewController which worked after a lot of hacking. But I just couldn't figure out
 how to present the info the way I wanted. The inflexibility and more complex coding made
 simple things like enlarging the cell height very hard.  So I am back to this VC.
 But I'm back to where I started which is not being able to identiy the indexPath.row value
 being presented by the view, making it much harder to increment/decrement the date.
 Looking at the date stamp on adding dates to this view, it was 2 weeks ago....8.28.
